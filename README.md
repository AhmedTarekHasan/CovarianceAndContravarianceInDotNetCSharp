<p>
If it is so hard on you to understand what Covariance and Contravariance in .NET C# means, don’t feel ashamed of it, you are not alone.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
It happened to me and many other developers. I even know experienced developers who either don’t know about them and are using them but still can’t understand them well enough.

<br/>

<p>
From where I see it, this is happening because every time I come across an article talking about Covariance and Contravariance, I find it focused on some technical terminologies rather than being concerned about the reason why we have them in the first place and what we would have missed if they didn’t exist.
